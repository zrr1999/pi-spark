# Spark Hub remote-access contract

This specification owns remote-access **authority, trust, and security
invariants**. User-facing Hub startup, browser-key, workspace-registration, and
reverse-proxy setup belong in the public
[`Hub Web guide`](../../../apps/spark-docs/src/content/docs/guides/hub.md).

## Authority layers

Hub browser authority is progressive and must remain separated:

1. **Hub access** authorizes the control plane. One `hub-user` session family
   covers owners and members; a member's workspace visibility is derived from
   explicit `user ↔ daemon` grants, and each workspace or session resolves to
   the daemon that owns it through the active lease.
2. **Hub↔daemon credentials** (`hub-daemon` family) authorize daemon
   connectivity. Enrollment tokens and device codes are one-shot bootstrap
   exchanges; the access/refresh pair they issue is the daemon's renewable
   credential, canonically recorded in `daemon_credentials`. They are never
   browser credentials.
3. **Daemon-user credentials** (`daemon-user` family) authorize direct Native
   Web access and are owned and verified by the daemon. The Hub must
   not issue, return, or forward them, and a `hub-user` session cannot log in
   to those surfaces.

Minting stays in `@zendev-lab/spark-hub-coordination` on the Hub host. No other
layer creates a minting authority.

A Hub member session must not open workspaces, sessions, artifacts, or SSE
owned by a daemon the member holds no grant for; revoking or moving a
workspace's lease re-derives authorization from the new owning daemon
immediately. Runtime credentials must never be accepted by any browser session
boundary, and browser credentials must never authenticate a daemon uplink.

## Network boundary

Hub is local-first and listens on loopback by default. Remote access must use
HTTPS or an explicitly opted-in insecure path on a trusted private network.
An encrypted private overlay or tunnel is preferred over exposing the Hub
listener directly.

A configured public URL must be an `http(s)` origin rooted at `/`; path mounting
is unsupported. A changed public origin changes daemon server identity and
requires affected workspace registrations to be refreshed deliberately.

## Trusted proxy contract

Proxy trust is explicit rather than inferred from forwarding headers.
`SPARK_HUB_TRUST_PROXY=loopback` is valid only when the Hub listener itself is
loopback-bound. A trusted proxy must:

- preserve the intended public host;
- replace or sanitize forwarding headers;
- provide the trusted `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` chain;
- forward WebSocket upgrades and unbuffered streaming responses;
- reject unknown public hosts.

`SPARK_HUB_PROXY_HOPS` bounds the trusted entries selected from the right side
of `X-Forwarded-For` to 1–10 hops. Automatic public-URL discovery is valid only
behind the same explicitly trusted loopback proxy.

Untrusted requests must not be allowed to select scheme, host, client address,
or authorization scope through forwarded headers.

## Browser credential contract

Hub browser keys are one-time credentials with bounded expiry. Every key is
minted with an explicit daemon grant list; exchanging it creates (or reuses) a
member hub-user and grants exactly those daemons before the session is issued.
Replay after successful exchange or explicit revocation fails. There are no
workspace-scoped browser keys or sessions: retired workspace-only sessions and
tokens were revoked by migration and stay invalid.

Grant authority follows the daemon, not a display name. Workspace names and
slugs are display/routing helpers and must not become authority identifiers.

Session refresh rotates credentials. Replaying the previous refresh credential
must fail. Hub and direct Web share the policy-free issuance and atomic refresh
primitive in `spark-platform-node/browser-session`. Hub keeps its own user/grant
checks and 30-day refresh lifetime; the daemon owns direct Web browser sessions
with 15-minute access and 7-day renewable refresh lifetimes. Startup daemon-user
tokens bootstrap browser sessions; launcher shutdown revokes the startup token
without revoking the established browser session. Credential hashes, expiry,
and revocation remain in each owner's database and never cross families. Static PWA assets and the minimum login/logout routes may remain
available before authorization, but protected data and event routes require a
session whose grants cover the owning daemon.

## Workspace registration boundary

Machine connectivity credentials and one-time workspace registration tokens are
different authorities and cannot substitute for one another. Each registration
consumes its own token and binds one daemon-owned directory to the existing Hub
workspace identity. Registering a daemon grants it to every active Hub owner
explicitly; further member reach is minted only through daemon-bound Hub access
keys.

Target execution remains daemon-owned. Browser authorization never grants
direct repository, daemon-store, or execution-state access outside the owner
APIs.

## Failure policy

Remote-access configuration fails closed when trust inputs conflict or cannot be
validated. In particular, ambiguous proxy trust, conflicting public origins,
replayed credentials, and cross-scope browser access must be rejected rather
than downgraded to local-owner behavior.
