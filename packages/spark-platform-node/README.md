# @zendev-lab/spark-platform-node

Node platform adapters for filesystem paths, private-file permissions, commands,
atomic JSON/text files, SQLite, local IPC, and runtime primitives shared by Spark
packages.

Daemon RPC transport and protocol-aware client code lives in
`@zendev-lab/spark-daemon-client`; this package deliberately has no Spark
workspace dependencies.

## Paths

`resolveSparkUserPaths()` derives Spark-owned user configuration, data, cache,
state, and runtime paths. `resolveSparkPaths({ app })` derives Hub/daemon paths
from those roots. `resolveSparkHome()` returns the explicit `SPARK_HOME` when
configured, otherwise the effective XDG data root for compatibility callers
that require one persistent root. `sparkStateRootPath()`,
`sparkWorkspaceStatePath()`, and `sparkStateCwd()` resolve workspace-local state
without routing Node path semantics through the Invocation contract.

Precedence is explicit API `sparkHome`, then `SPARK_HOME`; when neither is set, Spark follows `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` independently. Workspace state remains under each workspace `.spark/`. Public role, skill, and workflow definitions remain under `$HOME/.agents/`.

Retired Pi/component-specific path variables are not active overrides.

See [`../../.agents/notes/contracts/configuration-and-paths.md`](../../.agents/notes/contracts/configuration-and-paths.md) for layout, precedence, and migration policy.

This package is part of the Spark monorepo and targets Node 24 and newer.
Consumers that only need workspace path resolution or atomic file helpers use
the explicit `@zendev-lab/spark-platform-node/paths` and
`@zendev-lab/spark-platform-node/json-files` subpaths.

## Browser session primitives

`./browser-session` shares random access/refresh token issuance, SHA-256 hashing,
and transactional one-time refresh rotation between Hub and daemon owners.
Callers supply TTLs, credential prefixes, eligibility checks, and storage
operations; the platform module owns no credential store or authorization policy.
